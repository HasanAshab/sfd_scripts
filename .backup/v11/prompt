Lets create another script (Ujiri.cs) that includes 6 boss.
randomly 3 of them are Team1 and other 3 Team2

Timpa = when hp is low (30%) or killed a player give him IPlayer.SetStrengthBoostTime(15000)
Bichi = spawn a gun drone to closest AvailablePathNodes of the player every 5 seconds.
kokola = spawn a bot to closest AvailablePathNodes of the player every 5 seconds.
Edur = over hp loose, will be getting smaller in size and speed will be increasing
Xray = always gets guns laser pointer
Pakhi = hp increases every 1 seconds (no cooldown for combat or energy) and a downside of pakhi. if his hp decrease for any other player, they gets the hp that pakhi




now back to #Militia.cs. i want some changes.

1. One main elite bot (the main bot with the top behaviour class among others) will be consider as cornel at each team. his Profile will be
new IProfile()
{
    Name = "General",
    Gender = Gender.Male,
    Skin = new IProfileClothingItem("Tattoos", "Skin3", "ClothingLightYellow"),
    Head = new IProfileClothingItem("GeneralHat", "ClothingDarkYellow"),
    ChestUnder = new IProfileClothingItem("LeatherJacket", "ClothingDarkYellow", "ClothingLightYellow"),
    Waist = new IProfileClothingItem("Sash", "ClothingDarkYellow"),
    Legs = new IProfileClothingItem("CamoPants", "ClothingDarkYellow", "ClothingDarkYellow"),
    Feet = new IProfileClothingItem("BootsBlack", "ClothingGray"),
    Accesory = new IProfileClothingItem("Armband", "ClothingLightYellow"),
}
also dont forget to maintain PRIME_COLOR

2. Other main bots (main bots, not either rookies or captain) will guard the cornel (read BotBehaviorSet.GuardRange IPlayer.SetGuardTarget) 
3. instead of spawning rookies and captains at AvailablePathNodes, spawn them some very little pixel away from cornel. 
4. When their cornel dies, stop spawning new rookies and captains
5. the rookies and captains target will always try to kill opponents cornel (read IPlayer.SetForcedBotTarget)
